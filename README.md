# Simple Vanilla NodeJS API and front-end Proj 
## objective successfully achieved 

this project was made so I can understand more about nodejs, expressjs, middlewares, api, servers and fetch requests/responses.

I did it, now i understand more about how to use the minimum of all the tools that I could use to get a maximum result and depend as little as possible on frameworks and libs for a small application.

The tools that i'm using here are vannila nodejs that uses http, morgan to get a output on terminal of the requests, fs so I can modify the json, finalhandler handle errors, nodemon and vite. 

I could do better, but the objective was achieved using/simulating json as an DB, I do not recommend that in greater applications or applications that even small are going to be used at all, since there are a lot of barriers and insecurities in that path if you do it, do at your own risk and just for fun or study, and remember to find all possible insecurities and problems that are possible if using as a real application. 

next time I probably am going to clone this repo and make do the same but with MySQL, making it closer to a real application.
